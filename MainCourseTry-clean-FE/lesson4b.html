                <p><strong>Digital fashion marketing research:</strong></p>
                <p>It is the phenomenal growth in online retailing that has been blamed for the large number of retailers going out of busi- ness, a trend which is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Any discussion about fashion marketing research must therefore give some attention to digital marketing. Of course ‘e-commerce’ as an academic research subject has been around since the incep- tion of the World Wide Web as a medium for making purchases. Indeed in the field of fashion marketing, online fashion marketing has been widely researched and documented in the literature and although the breadth of this research has incorporated aspects such as consumer behaviour, web design, online strategy, social media and brand trust, the emphasis of the research has always been focused on online/desktop websites. However, the more recent phenomenal increase in the variety and number of devices through which consumers can access the internet, as well as the rise in popularity of social media, has resulted in a renewed interest in digital fashion marketing, with a shift towards mobile and omni-channel applications on the research agenda. Although retailers have developed successful online strategies, management consultant corporation Kurt Salmon reports that many have yet to grasp the value of successful multi-channel strategies.

                <p><strong>Mobile commerce: </strong></p>
                <p>
                    Consumers are increasingly moving to accessing online data via mobile devices with more consumers accessing the internet via a mobile rather than a fixed device, and mobile internet acceptance is on the increase. Mobile commerce allows consumers to access online content via a hand-held device, potentially allowing users to perform online transactions ‘anytime and anywhere’ and is considered to be the next generation of e- commerce. The Interactive Media in Retail Group (IMRG)  reported that nearly half of all the retailers were aiming to launch a transactional mobile website in 2011. Research into mobile commerce in the field of fashion marketing is important and repre- sents a new area for research development because, as Magrath and McCormick point out, because of differences in screen sizes, internet speed issues or even location usage, it cannot be assumed that the mobile consumer will have the same motivations, expectations and behaviours as the online consumer. Despite the importance of gaining understanding about the role of marketing in mobile commerce, academic research in the fashion marketing arena relating to mobile commerce has been sparse. One aspect of fash- ion mobile marketing that has been explored is that of mobile content design. In the same way that website design was researched in depth because the retail environment of a web- site is different to that of an in-store experience the design of the commer- cial content for a mobile device also has to be considered. Retailers are looking to develop content specifically for the mobile environment.
                    <br>
                    &emsp; Mobile website – the same as the retailer’s online/desktop website viewed via a mobile device;
                    <br>
                    &emsp; Web app – the retailer’s online/desktop website optimised for viewing on a mobile device;
                    <br>
                    &emsp; Mobile app – content designed specifically for use on a mobile device taking into account the format and functionality of the mobile device
                    <br>
                    &emsp; &emsp; The mobile app (mobile application software) is the channel of most interest since the use of apps is increasing significantly and mobile apps could soon become the most important sales channels in fashion marketing. In their research into mobile design for fashion retailers, Magrath and McCormick developed a framework organising mobile marketing design elements into four categories:
                    <br>
                    &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; 1. Multimedia product viewing
                    <br>&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; 2. Informative content
                    <br>&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; 3. promotional material
                    <br>&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; 4. consumer-led interactions

                </p>
                <p>
                    The research into mobile content design remains very much in its infancy and there are a number of interesting avenues for the research agenda in fashion marketing terms; for example, one of the key problems for online fashion retail has always been the diffi- culty of how to present the true look, feel, colour and texture of a garment. The problems remain the same for mobile commerce; yet, the interactive nature of browsing on mobile devices, which are usually touchscreen, offers opportunity for development of the interface to compensate for some of these issues. However, whilst academic research has tried to catch up with developments in mobile commerce, research may already have superseded the concept, as retailers are now moving towards an ‘omni-channel’ concept.
