                <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
                <p>Given what is known about marketing and ‘fashion’, the question is whether ‘fashion mar- keting’ can be considered to be significantly different from our understanding of ‘generic’ marketing. One of the first textbooks to be published on fashion marketing was Mike Easey’s text in which he argues that fashion marketing is different from other areas of marketing because of the changing nature of fashion and the role that design plays in the sector in terms of both leading and reflecting customer needs

                <p><strong>Fashion and Marketing</strong></p>
                <p>Fashion is about change and is driven by creativity. The very nature of fashion means it is something that has short-term popularity; so a fashion product has a limited life expec- tancy. Historically, fashion in garments has been driven by ‘seasonality’ whereby consumers bought new fashion garments in tune with the seasons, typically autumn/win- ter and spring/summer. However, over the last decade, the rise of ‘fast fashion’ has seen fashion life cycles contract to durations of sometimes only a few weeks, after which the fashion product becomes obsolete as a new set of fashion ranges become available. Fast fashion has been used strategically by fashion businesses as consumers have increasingly demanded newness and the latest fashions. Adopting a ‘fast fashion approach’ can be used to produce new fashion garments to replenish fast-selling lines, to react to new and emerging trends by introducing new ranges quickly and to keep ranges looking new and fresh in store. The rise of fast fashion has created a shift from ‘seasonal’ fashion products to a constant cycle of newness in the fashion sector.

                <p><strong>Defining fashion marketing:</strong></p>
                <p>If the definitions of marketing and fashion marketing are to embrace what is known about marketing in the fashion industry, and incorporate the unique characteristics of fashion as described earlier, it is possible to develop a broader view of fashion marketing and define it thus: 
                    Fashion marketing is concerned with understanding the complex needs and wants of consum- ers of fashion and with orienting both strategic and operational business activities to satisfy those demands; fashion marketing’s particular complexity as a business philosophy arises from the diversity of fashion-related influences which shape consumer needs combined with the fast-moving pace of fashion-product life-cycles. 
                    </p>
                <p><strong>The fashion marketing mix:</strong></p>
                <p>The marketing mix is the range of variables that can be controlled by the fashion marketer to meet the needs of buyers profitably. Simply put, the marketing mix is getting the right product to the chosen mar- ket segment at the correct time, in the right place and for the right price. Despite the limitations and debates around the marketing-mix paradigm discussed earlier, it remains a mainstay of marketing theory and defines the scope and structure of catego- ries of academic research and the way the subject is taught. The fashion marketing mix has some unique characteristics.
