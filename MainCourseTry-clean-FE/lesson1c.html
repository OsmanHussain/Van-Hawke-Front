                <p><strong>The shifting communication landscape:</strong></p>

                <p>At a time when information bombards the consumer at every turn, it has become increasingly challenging for any brand to be heard above the noise.
                    A hundred years ago the majority of consumers would have bought goods from local suppliers and would have perhaps been aware of a handful of international brands. As communication became easier with the development of television and radio, alternatives to local brands were offered and consumers were targeted by the new forms of advertising that came with these developments in communication. 
                    The development of the internet has brought about the most significant shift in the way in which we consume information about brands and also how we are influenced by them. The availability of information through digital channels, and the ease with which can share it with each other through social media, means that we no longer necessarily believe everything a brand tells us. We now demand more information about brands, we expect them to engage with us- almost on a one-to-one basis and we look to online word-of-mouth advertising feedback, above traditional sales patter. 
                    The speed at which information travels has increased dramatically and we no longer need to rely on ‘official’ sources such as newspapers and magazines. We have often already heard the news through our own personal channels of communication before it's officially released.
                </p>
                <p>The fast moving fashion industry, with its need to share ideas and imagery, engage with the customer or an emotional level, and to keep ahead of new trends, has embraced this new age of communication with enthusiasm. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>The new era of Sharing:</strong></p>
                <p>If a consumer wanted to gain an insight into New York style in the past, they would have to visit the city themselves or wait for the latest Magazine to cover the trends there. In - house researchers at fashion brands would have been conducting their own research, often travelling the globe and taking their own photographs or employing people at different locations to carry out the research for them. The insight that bloggers and street - style commentators give the consumer into what others are wearing has a strong influence on what consumers want to wear. This sharing of fashion and style trends inline has also made it considerably easier for brands to continually research street style and ensure that they stay in touch with what their customers want.
                </p>
                <p>Bloggers, by their nature, are all about sharing information, thoughts and opinions with others. They also share information with each other, so while there may be some competition between them, as information spreads throughout the network so too does their reach and profile, as well as that of their followers.
