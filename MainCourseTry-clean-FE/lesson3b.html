                <p><strong>Fashion Product:</strong></p>
                <p>Marketing theory defines a product as: Anything that can be offered to a market to satisfy a want or need’ and is made up of a core benefit i.e. what is the key benefit the customer is buying, bundled with a set of additional values including the ‘expected’ product i.e. what the customer expects to get with a product, the augmented product i.e how the marketer exceeds expectations (the level at which compe- tition normally takes place), and the ‘potential’ product i.e. future direction of the product.

                </p>
                <p>The expected and augmented levels of a product are where marketing typically plays a part, for example, through branding, sales promotion and retail offerings. This generic theory of product marketing can be applied to fashion products, and perhaps like no other category, the fashion marketing activity adding value to the core product is really the aspect of the product that satisfies the consumer need. For example, the core benefit or function of clothing is to provide protection and for modesty purposes. For fashion con- sumers the need goes beyond that, and is also related to design, style and brand, i.e. all the attributes that are operating at expected and augmented levels. A good example of the applicability of this theory is to consider a pair of jeans. Levi’s takes the credit for invent- ing the first pair of denim jeans back in the nineteenth century, having designed a new highly-durable garment for cowboys in the American west. Today Levi’s and other denim brands typically retail their jeans well above cost price, for example, in excess of $100. In some cases consumers are buying these high-priced garments for particular aspects of the design and style detail, but fundamentally the brand plays a huge part in determining which jeans consumers purchase; this is closely connected to the theme of fashion dis- cussed in the previous section, whereby fashion and what individuals wear is a key part of how individuals communicate, portray themselves and connect with others – the brand they wear is an important part of this process.

                <p><strong>Defining fashion marketing:</strong></p>
                <p>If the definitions of marketing and fashion marketing are to embrace what is known about marketing in the fashion industry, and incorporate the unique characteristics of fashion as described earlier, it is possible to develop a broader view of fashion marketing and define it thus: 
                    Fashion marketing is concerned with understanding the complex needs and wants of consum- ers of fashion and with orienting both strategic and operational business activities to satisfy those demands; fashion marketing’s particular complexity as a business philosophy arises from the diversity of fashion-related influences which shape consumer needs combined with the fast-moving pace of fashion-product life-cycles.

                <p>Typically, fashion products are divided into a set of categories not usually found in other sectors of marketing, inseparably connected to the concept of fashion having a lim- ited life cycle. In the earlier discussion about ‘fashion’, the PLC theory, diffusion theory and seasonal structure of fashion were presented, explaining that the life expectancy of a particular fashion could be a matter of a few weeks, one season or through many years. In fashion, the expected life cycles of various fashion products are used to categorise the products into what are termed fads, fashions or classic products. The fad products are those with a very short life cycle. These might typically be based on more extreme or unusual designs which appeal to only a limited group of consumers [33], for example, the bandage dress first introduced by the designer Herve Leger. Fashion products are typically those which run through their PLC in one distinct season whereas a classic fashion is one which remains fashionable enduringly; a typical example is the Chanel-style, five-pocket jacket.
