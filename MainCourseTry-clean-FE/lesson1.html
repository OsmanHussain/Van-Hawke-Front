                <h1 class="ql-align-center"><strong>Welcome to Fashion Marketing</strong></h1><br><br>

                <p>The fashion industry is tremendously fast-paced, consuming new ideas and trends at an astonishing rate. What is considered fashionable one day can be seen as outdated very next. It is important for any brand to keep ahead of the current trends, changes and successfully communicate their ideas and designs to build a loyal customer base. 
                    Global and economic factors influence what the world consumes and wears and fashion brands must consider the global audience more than ever before. With new online sales channels, the marketplace has become broader and more diverse, but also increasingly competitive.
                </p>
                <p>Fashion promotion and marketing is one of the fast-growth industries that has had to adapt to a massive shift in the way we all communicate. As print advertising revenues declines, magazines and newspapers go out of print and citizen journalism takes over, the promotion of a fashion brand has become a far more multifaceted phenomenon and varied exercise than it once was. 
                    In recent years, fashion promotion has primarily been driven by the explosion of social and digital media platforms and channels. 
                </p>
                <p>The knowledge of fashion and manufacturing has increased and small designers, manufacturers and retailers can now compete with larger established brands. </p>
                <p><strong>The concept of fashion:</strong></p>
                <p>The product element of the marketing mix is fundamental to the fash- ion design industry. The continual process of new product development and resulting change drives the whole industry and answers the demand from consumers for a constant stream of new ideas and offerings. Indeed it could be argued that without this constant gen- eration and introduction of new ideas into the marketplace, the con- cept of ‘fashion’ would not exist.
                </p>
                <p>Axiomatically, if consumers were not constantly engaged in the pro- cess of looking for new products or services to satisfy their emerging needs (and once having consumed them, allowing a set of new and different needs to emerge), the fashion process could not function.</p>
                <p>Thus the industry revolves around a time-based, i.e. seasonal, pro- cess in which new fashions are introduced into the marketplace and are adopted by enough consumers to warrant the description of ‘fashion’ in its proper context in the first place (as a current mode of consumption behaviour), only to wane eventually in terms of popular- ity, thus rendering them ‘unfashionable’. While some product offer- ings will remain popular over several or even many seasons, others will fade very quickly; these differences are discussed further in the chapter. The important point to stress here, however, is that this regenerative process is intrinsic to the fashion industry and is very necessary for its continued survival. </p>
