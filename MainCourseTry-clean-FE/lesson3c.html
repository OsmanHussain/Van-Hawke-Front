                <p><strong>Fashion promotion:</strong></p>
                <p>In general marketing theory, the idea of ‘promotion’ was derived from that of sales pro- motion, i.e. telling consumers about the product. This notion of promotion has, more recently, entered a new paradigm of promotion theory and is now more commonly referred to as marketing communications, taking into account the interactive dialogue between the company and its customers. The marketing communication mix includes advertising, sales promotion, public relations and publicity, personal selling and direct and interactive marketing. In fashion marketing communications (or fashion promo- tion), all the tools of the marketing communications mix tend to be utilised, but some more than others, and there are examples of techniques used in fashion marketing not used in other sectors. For example, the use of the fashion show and catwalk collections in generating publicity and press is a distinctive feature of fashion promotion. What is even more complex is that especially at the designer/luxury end of the market, the catwalk shows are used less to sell the clothes and more to sell the brand and their full range of branded products geared towards the mass market such as cosmetics, sunglasses and per- fumes. Another aspect of fashion promotion which is unique is the role played by the fashion press, in identifying and capturing the new fashions as they are presented on the catwalks. The styles they pick up and use in the highly stylised fashion shoots are the ones typically adopted by consumers. In a sense, the fashion press, particularly titles such as Vogue, Elle and Harper’s Bazaar, are the opinion leaders when applied to the ‘diffusion of innovation’ theory. The arrival of new technologies has changed that position some- what and what we see is a rise in importance of ‘fashion bloggers’, a change which links to the trickle-up theory discussed earlier. Indeed, the impact of digital technology on the fashion industry has been highly significant and represents a new paradigm for the indus- try and for fashion promotion and is therefore discussed in more detail later.
