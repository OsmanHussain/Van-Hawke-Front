                <p><strong>Adapting for the new consumer:</strong></p>

                <p>With global influences, market conditions, the explosion of digital communication, more demanding consumers and greater levels of competition, it is becoming increasingly difficult for fashion brands, large and small, to compete. Differentiators that enable brands to have a unique selling point (UPS) are becoming harder to define, as local markets develop to include global audiences, and luxury brands continue to expand their offering to mass markets.    
                    However, the growth in communication channels and access to two-way conversations with the customer means it is still possible to create a song, focused brand that appeals to the modern consumers means it is still possible to create a strong, focused brand that appeals to the modern consumers. More than ever before, brands are required to listen to the customer and respond accordingly, but this also means that product development can be efficiently targeted, and the marketing and promotional campaigns can be bespoke and responsive.     
                    Fashion collections and the people and creativity behind them are gaining more attention from the consumer, and the industry is still attracting enthusiastic apprentices and interns across most disciplines. The fashion and creative industries are receiving more business kudos from the government and increased levels of recognition and funding from the official bodies. Although the main challenge is to ensure the market remains customer-focused as well as  reactive and cutting edge, there remains a commercial vibe.                     
                </p>
                <p>Market research, creativity, strong brand stories, well-developed products, and responsiveness to customer feedback are all key to the creation of a brand that is appealing to the new consumer.
