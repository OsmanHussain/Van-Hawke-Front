                <p><strong>Fashion marketing research</strong></p>
                <p>Academic research in the field of fashion marketing is rooted in the social sciences and tends to be published in journals which are typically listed in the Association of Business Schools journal quality guide. However, fashion marketing research can also be found in textiles journals and other specialist research disciplines including sociology, geography, psychology, fashion theory, design and computer science.

                <p><strong>Fast Fashion Research </strong></p>
                <p>‘Fast fashion’ is a quick-response concept which has revolutionised and fundamentally changed the fashion industry. In the early 2000s, whilst ‘fast fashion’ was being widely reported in the fashion industry press and was gathering much momentum in the industry, it had been neglected in academic research. Given the interest in ‘fast fashion’ in fashion marketing research, the Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management ran a special edi- tion on ‘fast fashion research’ at which stage the emphasis of the research was on exploring and conceptualising the issues. When ‘fast fashion’ was first considered in the academic literature it was defined by Barnes and Lea-Greenwood  as a consumer- driven strategy, giving rise to a new model of supply chain management featuring a con- tinuous consumer influence on the entire pipeline. ‘Fast fashion’ has subsequently become a key feature in the UK fashion industry over the last decade. Although it was ini- tially regarded as a niche concept offered by a few key players such as Zara and H&M, versions of the concept have now been implemented by all the major own-label retailers in the UK fashion market, using enhanced and more effective supply chains to be quicker in responding to changing fashion and consumer demand. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>The fast fashion concept</strong></p>
                <p>The principle underpinning ‘fast fashion’ is the contraction of lead-times in getting new garments from concept to consumer. ‘Fast fashion’ is a model whereby retailers orientate their business strategies to reduce the time taken to get fashion products into store, based on a system of in-season buying so that product ranges are constantly updated throughout the season. The ‘fast fashion’ approach also takes into account changing con- sumer demand, which characterises a move away from supply chains driven by manufac- turer/designer ‘push’ to demand chains driven by consumer ‘pull’. Therefore, the impetus that underpins the ‘fast fashion’ concept is lead-time and consumer demand
                </p>
                <p>‘Fast fashion’ is a business strategy which aims to reduce the processes involved in the buy- ing cycle and lead-times for getting new fashion products into stores, in order to satisfy con- sumer demand at its peak. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    The introduction of consumer demand as a determinant of ‘fast fashion’ indicates a development of the theory of fast fashion, building on the in-season buying and reduced lead-time concept by incorporating ‘newness’ as a key feature of ‘fast fashion’, in other words, by recurrent renewal and updating of ranges and merchandise distributed to the store to satisfy the demands of and hold onto the attention of consumers.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Fashion Trends And Consumer Demand</strong></p>
                <p>A combination of factors has taken place in the fashion market which has contributed to the rise of ‘fast fashion’. Fashion trends follow the principle of PLC management, whereby products have a limited lifetime in the marketplace from their introduction to the market, through maturity to decline. There has been a steady contraction in the length of fashion PLCs which has put pressure on retailers to re-stock more frequently, as they need more ranges to keep up to date with new fashions/trends as they emerge; the pressure is high because PLCs of fashion products have decreased from months to weeks and even to days.

                <p>
                    Consumers have become increasingly fashion ‘savvy’ and are interested in fashion and appearance for a longer part of their lives; therefore, the size of the market and demand for fashion products has increased. It is suggested that the phenomenal growth in media and magazine availability and their coverage of fashion has contributed to this growth in the fashion-aware consumer. As consumers become more confi- dent about fashion, the growth in demand for new fashion products increases, and in the UK fashion, consumers now want ever-changing styles. Mintel identified the importance of media in influencing trend-searching behaviour on the high street, whereby consumers look to magazines for ideas about the latest trends and then actively search for these key pieces. Weekly glossy magazines in particular have been identified as key infor- mation providers and, increasingly television shows have also developed a strong fashion focus. Indeed fashion pervades all aspects of the media from broadsheets to tabloid news- papers, and from popular television shows to serious documentaries, and is a particular feature of the twenty-first century zeitgeist. Catwalks have traditionally been the drivers of fashion and Zara’s ‘fast fashion’ proposition has been based on the interpreta- tion of catwalk trends; however, celebrity-driven trends are also very important at high-street level, as fashion consumers look to celebrities (usually through the weekly magazines) as style advisers. This interest in fashion means that consumers are shop- ping more frequently as demand is driven by weekly magazines and daily television shows; so they expect to see new looks and the latest pieces every time they shop. Therefore, it can be concluded that ‘fast fashion’ is motivated by catwalk styles, celebrity looks and the desire for newness, particularly in the case of those items identified in the media which create interest and drive high levels of consumer demand.

                <p><strong>Fast Fashion And Supply Chain Concepts</strong></p>
                <p>The theoretical underpinning of ‘fast fashion’ is derived from the literature of supply chain management. ‘Fast fashion’ is about the ability to react to trends and improve response times; therefore ‘fast fashion’ is linked with the concept of supply chain management and quick response. By analysing these supply chain concepts, the notion of ‘fast fashion’ is characterised by interrogation of supply chain theories with the fashion consumer at its heart. Barnes and Lea-Greenwood summarised the moves to improve responsiveness of supply chains in the fashion industry that have been made with the introduction of concepts such as the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;  Just-in-time (JIT) – Bruce et al. addressed JIT in a fashion context considering it to be the delivery of finished goods just enough to meet consumer demand rather than producing large quantities in advance and holding expensive inventory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;  Agile supply chains – these have been addressed describing shorter, more flexible, demand-driven supply chains. The key difference in agile supply chains, is that they are driven by information such as market data and information sharing between businesses in the supply chain. To fulfil consumer demand for ‘fast fash- ion’, attention has to be paid to the ability to respond to dynamic fashion consumer demand. It suggests that sourcing garments closer to consumer markets, particularly in Continental Europe, creates the required agile supply networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp; Quick response – it is synonymous with processes adopted to improve the adapt- ability of the textile and apparel supply chain, more recently applied to fashion-for- ward garments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp; Demand chains – in a study outside the fashion industry, the concept of having cus- tomer-focused supply chains was defined as ‘efficient physical supply of the product
