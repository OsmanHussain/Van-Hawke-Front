                <p><strong>Criteria for selecting segments:  </strong></p>

                <p>The bases for analysing market segments have just been described. Before developing a segmentation strategy one must select a seg- ment or segments as a focus for marketing efforts. There are four main criteria that should be taken into account to achieve this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. The segment should be measurable and easily identifiable. Before allocating marketing resources the target should be quantified. Producing garments to appeal to ‘art lovers’ may sound a good idea, but until it is known how to identify ‘art lovers’ and work out the market size little progress can be made. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. The chosen segment or segments should be relatively stable. Within the context of fashion this factor may seem ironic. However, fashion marketers invest considerable resources in building distribution networks and marketing information sys- tems geared to particular groups or segments of customers and there must be the assurance that investment will yield long-term results. While styles may evolve over successive seasons, it is hoped that the core segment will remain loyal to the fashion marketer who leads and reflects their fashion tastes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. The segment or segments chosen should be accessible. Accessibility refers to both distribution and promotional efforts. The role of demographic data in simplifying decisions about reaching the chosen segments has been described in the pre- vious section.
                </p><p>
                    4. The segment should be large enough to be profitable for the scale of operations of the fashion marketer. Opening a bou- tique for women aged 35 plus in a small country town may be a sensible move for a small entrepreneur, but not for a large multiple retailer. It cannot be stressed enough that the long- term goal should be profitability rather than sales or market share. It is far better to have 7% of a high margin market earn- ing £500 000 profit per week than 15% of a low margin market earning £196000 profit per week. 
                    Many companies describe their typical customers on websites, press releases or in advertisements, and this can give an indication of their tar- get markets. However these statements can often be an aspiration rather than a reality as they are usually intended to flatter and attract consumers rather than defining the market segments in a way that informs mar- keting decision-makers. On their website, Warehouse describes their customers as ‘Passionate about fashion, Knowledgeable about trends, Appreciates design and quality, Body confident, Independent and pri- marily 18–30, but Warehouse is about attitude not age!’ This description is a nice complement to potential customers, but may not fully meet the criteria mentioned above for selecting a segment.  
                </p>
                <p><strong>Segmentation strategies: </strong></p>
                <p>Segmentation strategies can range from the choice of one target mar- ket or segment within the market to the selection of several segments in the market, each with a different marketing mix. The selection of only one segment is known as concentration strategy and the selec- tion of two or more segments is called a multi-segment strategy.
                    The determinants of a segmentation strategy are the company resources, the nature of the competition and the nature of demand in the particular fashion market, for instance, whether it is stable or volatile. A concentration strategy can enable the company to become expert in satisfying one segment of customers and so to acquire enough prestige and goodwill to foster loyalty among customers, Herbert Johnson (Hats), established in 1889, being one such example. The risk of a concentration strategy is that a downturn in one market can expose the company to considerable financial risk.                     
                </p>
                <p>
                    A multi-segment strategy can provide a measure of stability in times of rapid market change by spreading risk across several segments. The same firm, while offering different marketing mixes, may find that the effort affords some economies of scale. For example, a company may target male and female segments via magazine advertising, and bulk purchasing of media space in magazines within the same pub- lishing group may enable larger discounts to be earned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many companies have changed from a concentration segmentation strategy to a multi-segment strategy in a desire to expand or main- tain growth rates. Both Jockey and Sloggi now produce underwear for males and females, having expanded from single-sex segments of the market. Sometimes the expansion into new segments can have a number of teething troubles, as with Jigsaw’s first attempts to move into menswear and Marks and Spencer’s recurrent attempts to target younger women.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The size of the customers is changing. Few people have the figure of a catwalk model and retailers recognizing this are offering more ranges in a wider variety of sizes. Taller consumers can buy from Long Tall Sally, a retailer who offers longer-length clothing. Evans Collection specializes in clothes for women of size 14 and over. Petite ranges for shorter women are now being offered alongside the usual ranges in many stores; Principles Petite is one example. One leading clothing retailer, well known for floral designs, had tried to target a new market – that for boys between 8 and 11 – only to real- ize that particular age group often places great emphasis on distance from the feminine domain. Fortunately the lesson was learned after only a limited amount of experimentation with the new market segment and at small cost. Had the same retailer chosen a more masculine name and different outlets the outcome might have been very different. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>Multi-segment strategies in practice:</strong></p>
                <p>The idea of segmentation has been taken on board by most of the high street retailers. Several large groups try to cover the whole market by having a variety of stores catering for different groups of customers. The Arcadia Group plc (formerly the Burton Group) was formed in 1998 at the same time as the demerger of Debenhams. Under the Arcadia Group are Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Evans, Outfit, Bhs, Tammy, Top Shop, Top Man, Wallis and Miss Selfridge. Dorothy Perkins and Burton offer affordable mainstream clothing for women and men, respectively, and Evans is the UK market leader for larger size womenswear. The group has a significant online presence with an e-commerce and Internet service provider called Zoom. In total the group has over 2500 outlets, is the second largest clothing retailer in the UK and has over 2.7 million active store card customers. In inter- national markets the Arcadia Group has over 420 stores and operates in over 30 countries. Total sales for the group exceeded £1.85 billion in 2007
                </p>
                <p>
                    Labels offered at Top Man are aimed at fashion orientated 15- to 25-year-old men looking for keen pricing. Burton aims at 25–40 year olds who are primarily socio-economic groups BC1C2; in 2007 they launched a premium Black Label featuring classic designs and higher grade fabrics for the less price conscious customer. Miss Selfridge offers clubwear, Wallis concentrates on stylish well-cut clothes. Thus within the Arcadia Group as a whole there will be some crossover of appeal for each brand, but the current emphasis of the group is on building distinctive labels
